            <p>You may end your legal agreement with Hapity at any time for any reason by
                deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services.</p>

                limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you
                create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the
                Services to you is no longer commercially viable. In all such cases, the Terms shall
                terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except

            <p>Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of Hapity to change, limit or stop

            <p>You will indemnify and hold harmless Hapity and its officers, directors, employees
                and agents, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages,
                losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and

                DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h3>
            <p>Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Hapity and its
                parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors,
                employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the
                “Hapity Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum
                extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
                disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as
                a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section
                is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
            <b>SUBSECTION A: The Services Are Available “AS-IS”</b>
            <p>Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk. You
                understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS
                AVAILABLE” basis. Without limiting the foregoing, Hapity Entities disclaim all
                warranties and conditions, whether express or implied, of merchantability, fitness
                for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
            <p>Hapity Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for:
                (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of
                the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or
                other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services, or any Content;
                (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other
                communications maintained by the Services; (iv) whether the Services will meet your
                requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No
                advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Hapity Entities or
                through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>
            <b>SUBSECTION B: Links</b>
            <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge
                and agree that we are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or
                accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services
                on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources
                do not imply any endorsement by Hapity Entities of such websites or resources or the
                content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You
                acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any
                such websites or resources.</p>
            <b>SUBSECTION C: Limitation of Liability</b>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Hapity Entities shall not be
                liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or
                any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any
                loss of data, use, good-will, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your
                access to or use of or inability to access or use the services; (ii) any conduct or
                content of any third party on the services, including without limitation, any
                defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties; (iii) any
                content obtained from the services; or (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration
                of your transmissions or content.</p>
            <p>In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Hapity Entities exceed the greater
                of one hundred euro (€ 100.00) or the amount you paid Hapity, if any, in the past
                year for the services giving rise to the claim.
                The limitations of this subsection shall apply to any theory of liability, whether
                based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, and
                whether or not the Hapity Entities have been informed of the possibility of any such
                damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its
                essential purpose.

                GENERAL TERMS </h3>
            <b>SUBSECTION: Waiver and Severability</b>
            <p>The failure of Hapity to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
                deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these
                Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or
                eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these
                Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <b>SUBSECTION: Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</b>
            <p>These Terms are governed by UK law</p>
            <b>SUBSECTION: Entire Agreement</b>
            <p>These Terms, the Community Guidelines and our Privacy Policy are the entire and
                exclusive agreement between Hapity and you regarding the Services (excluding any
                services for which you have a separate agreement with Hapity that is explicitly in
                addition to or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any
                prior agreements between Hapity and you regarding the Services and Content.</p>
            <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, and the most current version will always
                be at [INSERT RELEVANT URL HERE]. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is
                material we will notify you via email to the email associated with your account or
                through the Services. If you do not wish to be bound by any such revisions to the
                Terms, you must end these Terms with us as set forth under “ENDING THESE TERMS”. By
                continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you
                agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
            <p>These Services are operated and provided by Hapity. If you have any questions about
                these Terms, please contact us. </p>
